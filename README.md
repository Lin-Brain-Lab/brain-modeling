# Brain modeling

We attempt to build models to predict 
- brain dynamics at a given location based on the brain dynamics at other locations
- Subsequent brain dynamics at a given location based on preceding dynamics
- individual's demographic and subjective ratings based on brain dynamics

The disconcordance between the predicted dynamics or individual's traits can suggest a resilient or deteriorated neurological condition, mental health status, development stages, or aging processes.
